# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the project!

## Development Process

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Implement your changes and add tests.
4. Ensure all tests pass.
5. Create a pull request.

## Code Style

We use:
- **Black** for formatting.
- **Ruff** for linting.
- **mypy** for type checking.

Run `pre-commit install` to automatically perform these checks before each commit.
